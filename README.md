# Maze

Currently, this just contains structs and functions that generate mazes on console. main.c contains sample usage for initializing the maze, generating and then printing it out. Note: an odd number of columns and rows should be used for proper generation.

I'm temporarily putting this project on hold.

Future plans are:
1) Implement a GUI for visualizing the maze. I might make it into a maze game. 
2) Implement a solver for the maze (probably will be using DF traversal since I use a stack anyways)
3) Implement a function for choosing a starting and end point

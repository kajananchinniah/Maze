# Maze

Currently, this just contains structs and functions that generate mazes on console. I'm temporarily putting this project on hold.

Future plans are:
1) Implement a GUI for visualizing the maze
2) Implement a solver for the maze (probably will be using DF traversal since I use a stack anyways)
3) Implement a function for choosing a starting and end point
